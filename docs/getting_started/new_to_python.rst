New To Python, GitHub, or Conda
===============================

Although you do not need to know Python to use MELODIES MONET, it can be beneficial, and is 
needed to contribute to development. If you are new to Python, GitHub, or Conda, please refer to 
the following resources recommended by our development team.

Python
------

A great resource for learning Python specific for the geosciences is 
`Project Pythia <https://projectpythia.org/>`__.
The `Pythia Foundations Book <https://foundations.projectpythia.org/>`__
is particularly useful with a comprehensive set of tutorials covering the basics of Python coding. 
Tutorials we specifically recommend to new Python users include the following. Note that FAQ,
installation instructions, and code to go along with these videos are posted in the notes section 
of each video.

* `Jupyter Notebooks <https://youtu.be/xSzXvwzFsDU>`__
* `Pandas <https://youtu.be/BsV3ek7qsiM>`__
* `Matplotlib <https://youtu.be/EiPRIdHQEmE>`__
* `Cartopy <https://youtu.be/ivmd3RluMiw>`__
* `Xarray <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a339Q5F48UQ>`__

Another great resource for learning Python specific for atmospheric and geophysical sciences 
are the `Python Tutorials <https://sage.nelson.wisc.edu/data-and-models/python-tutorials/>`__
developed by Tracey Holloway's Group at the University of Wisconsin. Once you register, 
you will receive a link to the tutorials.

GitHub
------

We use GitHub to manage our MELODIES MONET code. Please refer to 
`Getting Started with GitHub on Project Pythia <https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/getting-started-github.html>`__
to learn more about GitHub.

If you are planning to contribute code back to our MELODIES MONET code repository,
we recommend for you to add an ssh key to your Github account. Please follow these instructions from
`Github <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account>`__.

Conda
-----

We have created a conda-forge release of MELODIES MONET to make installation very simple.
Conda is a package manager and environment management system. Please refer to 
`Installing and Managing Python with Conda on Project Pythia <https://foundations.projectpythia.org/foundations/conda.html>`__
to learn more about Conda.
