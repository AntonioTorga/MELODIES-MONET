**Oct 2024 MELODIES MONET 2-Day Tutorial**

October 15-16, 2024 - A hybrid `MELODIES MONET Tutorial <https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/events/melodies-tutorial-2024>`__
was hosted at the NCAR Foothills laboratory in Boulder, CO and online. This tutorial 
provided lectures on MELODIES MONET capabilities, hands on exercises for users to 
learn the tool, and break out sessions with the MELODIES MONET development team 
to learn how to add new features into the tool. The slides and recordings are all 
on the public
`Tutorial Agenda Website <https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/events/414344/agenda>`__,
so that any new user who could not attend the tutorial can still get full and 
easy access to this information.

**MELODIES MONET tutorial during the MUSICA Tutorial Series**

March 11, 2022 - During the `MUSICA tutorial <https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/event/workshop/musica-tutorial-2021>`__,
we demonstrated how to use MELODIES MONET to evaluate against surface 
observations, discussed current and future development goals, and encouraged 
more collaboration with others in the community.

**Results from 2020 user survey**

A survey of the atmospheric chemistry community was conducted in Nov-Dec 2020 
to identify existing model evaluation tools and to catalog desired features of 
model-observation comparison software.  30 responses were received, with 80% 
being researchers who run models and 20% who primarily analyze observations.  
There was equal interest in using satellite retrievals, field campaign in situ 
data, and surface or ground-based networks.  The respondents included users of 
17 unique models and covered a wide range of areas of research, including air 
quality, gas-phase and aerosol chemistry, cloud interactions, marine chemistry, 
emissions inventories, data assimilation and public health. This survey 
informed development priorities.
