Results from 2020 user survey
-----------------------------
A survey of the atmospheric chemistry community was conducted in Nov-Dec 2020 to identify existing model evaluation tools and to catalog desired features of model-observation comparison software.  30 responses were received, with 80% being researchers who run models and 20% who primarily analyze observations.  There was equal interest in using satellite retrievals, field campaign in situ data, and surface or ground-based networks.  The respondents included users of 17 unique models and covered a wide range of areas of research, including air quality, gas-phase and aerosol chemistry, cloud interactions, marine chemistry, emissions inventories, data assimilation and public health. This survey informaed development priorities.
