**Results from 2020 user survey**
A survey of the atmospheric chemistry community was conducted in Nov-Dec 2020 
to identify existing model evaluation tools and to catalog desired features of 
model-observation comparison software.  30 responses were received, with 80% 
being researchers who run models and 20% who primarily analyze observations.  
There was equal interest in using satellite retrievals, field campaign in situ 
data, and surface or ground-based networks.  The respondents included users of 
17 unique models and covered a wide range of areas of research, including air 
quality, gas-phase and aerosol chemistry, cloud interactions, marine chemistry, 
emissions inventories, data assimilation and public health. This survey 
informaed development priorities.
