Adding New Datasets
===================

Observations
------------

Examples for how to read in data from Aeronet, AirNow, and Improve are in the
``examples/process_obs`` folder in the MELODIES MONET repository
`on GitHub <https://github.com/NOAA-CSL/MELODIES-MONET>`__.
Use these examples as reference in order to add new surface observational datasets.

Instructions for reading in aircraft and satellite observations are under development. 

Models
------
Examples for reading model datasets can be
found in the ``monetio/models`` folder in the MONETIO repository
`on GitHub <https://github.com/noaa-oar-arl/monetio>`__.
These include e.g., _cesm_fv_mm.py, _cmaq_mm.py, and _wrfchem_mm.py.
While a part of the MONETIO repository,
the private MELODIES MONET readers are designated with prefix ``_mm``.

Support for additional models is also under developed.
